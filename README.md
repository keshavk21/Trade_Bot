# ðŸ“ˆ LLM-Powered Stock Trading Strategy Generator

This project is a prototype to **fine-tune an open-source code generation model** that can suggest **buy/sell trading decisions** in the form of **executable code snippets**. It combines test data generated using frontier LLMs and fine-tunes a smaller open-source model to replicate similar behavior in a cost-efficient and customizable manner.
